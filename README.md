# Time Data API Server

This project offers a straightforward Node.js HTTP server that provides time data via JSON APIs. It includes two endpoints, `/api/parsetime` and `/api/unixtime`, which process an ISO 8601 date string to return human-readable time components or a UNIX timestamp, respectively.
